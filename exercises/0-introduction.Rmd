# Introduction to R Studio and R Markdown

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Good job.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*. Go ahead and do that in the space below. Enter `2 + 3` in the new chunk and *run* the chunk.



Nice.

You can hide or clear the output for any chunck using the icons on the top right of the chunk outout. Try that now.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

**Note:** If you are running a notebook in RStudio Cloud, you may have to tell your browser to allow pop-ups from rstudio.cloud.

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
