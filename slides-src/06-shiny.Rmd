# Shiny

## Overview

- Web apps written completely in R

- Shiny generates a web UI consisting of HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

- The web server executes R code

- The UI interacts with the R server using websockets

- You only have to write R code

When the Shiny app is deployed in production, a web server runs the R program that serves the app.

The R program processes data and generates the UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

The UI (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) runs in the user's web browser.

# Shiny

## Shiny app structure

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage()

server <- function(input, output) {}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

# Shiny

## Reactivity

Shiny has three kinds of objects for reactive programming.

![Reactive roles](assets/reactive-roles.png)

The simplest structure of a reactive program involves just a source and an endpoint:

## Reactivity example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  })
}
```

## Deploying your app

* [Shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io) - hosting service from RStudio ($, includes a free tier)

* [Shiny server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/) - open source, deploy to your own server or Docker container

* [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) - RStudio publishing platform for Shiny apps, RMarkdown reports, Plumber API's, dashboards, and more ($$$)
