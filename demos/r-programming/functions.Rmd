The formula for the mean of a sample of $n$ values $X_1$, $X_2$, ... $X_n$ is

$${\overline{X}} = {\frac{1}{n}} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$

The formula for sample variance of those values is

$$s^{2}={\frac{1}{n-1}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(X_{i}-{\overline{X}}\right)^{2}$$

where ${\overline{X}}$ is the sample mean.

Even though R already has functions to compute these values, let's write our own for practice.

```{r}
my_mean <- function(x) {
}
```

```{r}
my_mean(1:10)
```

Compare R's `mean` function.

```{r}
mean(1:10)
```

```{r}
my_variance <- function(x) {
}
```

```{r}
my_variance(1:10)
```

Compare R's `var` function.

```{r}
var(1:10)
```
